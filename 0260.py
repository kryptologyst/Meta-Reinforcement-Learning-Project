# Project 260. Meta-reinforcement learning
# Description:
# Meta-Reinforcement Learning teaches agents how to learn new tasks quickly by learning from a distribution of tasks. It’s sometimes called “learning to learn”. The goal is to train a meta-policy that can adapt to new environments using very few experiences, mimicking how humans transfer prior knowledge.

# In this project, we simulate meta-learning using RL^2-style encoding: we train a policy that learns not just from the current state, but also from past observations, actions, and rewards — giving it a memory of how to act in new tasks.

# 🧪 Python Implementation (Mini Meta-RL Simulation using Memory-Augmented Policy):

# ✅ What It Does:
# Trains a memory-augmented policy (via GRU) to adapt within a task.

# Learns across multiple tasks — generalizes and transfers learning.

# Demonstrates how meta-learning helps in few-shot adaptation.

# Foundation for techniques like MAML, RL^2, and PEARL.
